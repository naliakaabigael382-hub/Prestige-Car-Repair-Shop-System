### Project Description
The project aims to develop an interactive and functional web and android application for a local automobile repair shop. The application will allow customers to have access and book a variety of services (towing, oil change, tire changes, regular maintenance, car repairs, etc.) which are offered by qualified technicians/mechanics working at the company. The technicians will be able to view their upcoming appointments and the administrator's assistant will be able to moderate, manage the shop's appointments and technician work schedule through the platform. This project is an updated/advanced version of a part of the ECSE321 project.
